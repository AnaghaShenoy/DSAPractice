## Description

The task is to complete the `insert()` function, which is used to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- `N = 5`
- `arr[] = {4, 1, 3, 9, 7}`

**Output:** `1 3 4 7 9`

**Explanation:** In this example, the Insertion Sort algorithm is used to sort the given array in ascending order.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- `N = 10`
- `arr[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}`

**Output:** `1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10`

**Explanation:** In this example, the Insertion Sort algorithm is used to sort the given array in ascending order.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete two functions:

1. `insert()`: This function takes the array, its size, and an index `i`. It inserts the element at index `i` into its correct position within the sorted subarray.
   
2. `insertionSort()`: This function uses the `insert()` function to sort the array in ascending order using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## Constraints

- `1 <= N <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(N^2)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
