## Description

You are given a sorted array `arr[]` of distinct integers. Your task is to sort the array into a wave-like array **in-place**. In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that `arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5]...`.

If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

**Note:** The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- `n = 5`
- `arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}`

**Output:** `2 1 4 3 5`

**Explanation:** Array elements, after sorting it into a wave-like form, are `2 1 4 3 5`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- `n = 6`
- `arr[] = {2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10}`

**Output:** `4 2 8 7 10 9`

**Explanation:** Array elements, after sorting it into a wave-like form, are `4 2 8 7 10 9`.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `convertToWave()`, which converts the given array to a wave array **in-place**.

## Constraints

- `1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^6`
- `0 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 10^7`

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
