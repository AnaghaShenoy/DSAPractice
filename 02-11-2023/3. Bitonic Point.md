## Description

You are given an array `arr` of `n` elements that is first strictly increasing and then may be strictly decreasing. Your task is to find the maximum element in the array.

**Note:** If the array is increasing, just print the last element, which will be the maximum value.

### Example 1:

**Input:** 
- `n = 9`
- `arr[] = {1, 15, 25, 45, 42, 21, 17, 12, 11}`

**Output:** `45`

**Explanation:** In this example, the maximum element is 45.

### Example 2:

**Input:** 
- `n = 5`
- `arr[] = {1, 45, 47, 50, 5}`

**Output:** `50`

**Explanation:** In this example, the maximum element is 50.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `findMaximum()`, which takes the array `arr[]` and `n` as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer.

## Constraints

- `3 ≤ n ≤ 10^6`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6`

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(logn)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
