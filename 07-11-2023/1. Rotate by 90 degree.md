## Description

Given a square matrix of size N x N, the task is to rotate it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- N = 3 
- `matrix[][] = {{1, 2, 3},
              {4, 5, 6},
              {7, 8, 9}}`

**Output:**
Rotated Matrix:
3 6 9
2 5 8
1 4 7


**Explanation:** In this example, the task is to rotate the given square matrix by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- N = 2
- `matrix[][] = {{1, 2},
              {3, 4}}`

**Output:**
Rotated Matrix:
2 4
1 3


**Explanation:** In this example, the task is to rotate the given square matrix by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `rotateby90()`, which takes the matrix as an input parameter and rotates it by 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space. You have to modify the input matrix in-place.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- 1 <= matrix[][] <= 1000

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(N^2)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
