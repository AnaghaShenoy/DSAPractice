## Description

A matrix is constructed of size n * n, such that Mi, j = i + j. Count the number of cells having value q. Note: Assume, the array is in 1-based indexing.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- n = 4, q = 7

**Output:**
2


**Explanation:** In this example, a matrix is constructed, and the task is to count the number of cells with the value `q`. The matrix looks like this:

2 3 4 5
3 4 5 6
4 5 6 7
5 6 7 8


The count of `7` is `2`.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- n = 5, q = 4

**Output:**
3


**Explanation:** In this example, a matrix is constructed, and the task is to count the number of cells with the value `q`. The matrix looks like this:

2 3 4 5 6
3 4 5 6 7
4 5 6 7 8
5 6 7 8 9
6 7 8 9 10


The count of `4` is `3`.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `sumMatrix()`, which takes two integers `n` and `q` as input and returns the count of `q` in the n * n matrix.

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 10^18

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
