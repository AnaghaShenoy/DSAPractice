## Description

You are given two strings, `a` and `b`, consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether these two strings are anagrams of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, with the only difference being the order of characters. For example, "act" and "tac" are anagrams of each other.

**Note:**
- If the strings are anagrams, you have to return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

|s| represents the length of string `s`.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- `a = "geeksforgeeks"`
- `b = "forgeeksgeeks"`

**Output:** `YES`

**Explanation:** Both strings have the same characters with the same frequency. So, they are anagrams.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- `a = "allergy"`
- `b = "allergic"`

**Output:** `NO`

**Explanation:** Characters in both strings are not the same, so they are not anagrams.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `isAnagram()`, which takes the string `a` and the string `b` as input parameters and checks if the two strings are anagrams of each other. The function returns `True` if the strings are anagrams; otherwise, it returns `False`.

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ |a|, |b| ≤ 10^5`

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(|a| + |b|)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(Number of distinct characters)
