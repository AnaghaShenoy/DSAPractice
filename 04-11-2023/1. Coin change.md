## Description

You are given an integer array `coins[]` of size `N` representing different denominations of currency and an integer `sum`. Your task is to find the number of ways you can make the sum by using different combinations from `coins[]`.

**Note:** Assume that you have an infinite supply of each type of coin, and you can use any coin as many times as you want.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- `N = 3`
- `sum = 4`
- `coins = {1, 2, 3}`

**Output:** `4`

**Explanation:** In this example, there are four possible ways to make the sum: {1, 1, 1, 1}, {1, 1, 2}, {2, 2}, and {1, 3}.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- `N = 4`
- `Sum = 10`
- `coins = {2, 5, 3, 6}`

**Output:** `5`

**Explanation:** In this example, there are five possible ways to make the sum: {2, 2, 2, 2, 2}, {2, 2, 3, 3}, {2, 2, 6}, {2, 3, 5}, and {5, 5}.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `count()`, which accepts an array `coins`, its size `N`, and `sum` as input parameters and returns the number of ways to make change for the given sum of money.

## Constraints

- `1 <= sum, N, coins[i] <= 10^3`

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(sum*N)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(sum)
