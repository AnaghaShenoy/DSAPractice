## Description

Write a program to find the transpose of a square matrix of size N*N. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
- N = 4
- `mat[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
              {2, 2, 2, 2},
              {3, 3, 3, 3},
              {4, 4, 4, 4}}`

**Output:**
{{1, 2, 3, 4},
{1, 2, 3, 4},
{1, 2, 3, 4},
{1, 2, 3, 4}}


**Explanation:** In this example, the task is to find the transpose of the given square matrix.

### Example 2:

**Input:**
- N = 2
- `mat[][] = {{1, 2},
              {-9, -2}}`

**Output:**
{{1, -9},
{2, -2}}


**Explanation:** In this example, the task is to find the transpose of the given square matrix.

## Your Task

Your task is to complete the function `transpose()`, which takes `matrix[][]` and `N` as input parameters and finds the transpose of the input matrix in-place. This means you need to update the original matrix with its transpose.

## Constraints

- 1 <= N <= 103
- -10^9 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^9

### Complexity Requirements

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(N * N)
- **Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(1)
