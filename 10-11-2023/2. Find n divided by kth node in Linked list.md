# Problem Statement
[Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-nk-th-node-in-linked-list/1?page=1&difficulty=Basic&sprint=ca8ae412173dbd8346c26a0295d098fd&sortBy=submissions)
Given a singly linked list and a number k. Write a function to find the (N/k)th element, where N is the number of elements in the list. We need to consider ceil value in case of decimals.

## Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case consists of an integer N. The second line consists of N spaced integers. The last line consists of an integer k.

**Example:**
2
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
2
5
2 7 9 3 5
3

## Output:
Print the data value of (N/k)th node in the Linked List.

**Example:**
3
7

## User Task:
The task is to complete the function fractional_node() which should find the n/kth node in the linked list and return its data value.

## Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 100
- K > 0
